Environment
-----------

Target environment for running tests

Two machines
1. Controller
   - Machine running Linux which controls the test
   - Has ssh access to board
2. Board
   - board to be tested
   - Provides ssh access to board

Root File System of Board
- I use NFS root
- On some boards it is possible to use local flash
- For tests with minimal dependencies it may be possible to use an initrd


1. Ensure that python 2.7 is installed on the controller

2. Ensure that sshd is running on board

   - Ideally this should happen automatically on boot

3. Manually install test on board
   - Contents of tests/ltsi-3.10/board/

4. Ensure any hardware required by board is in place
   e.g. SD card inserted

5a. Controller executes tests found in tests/ltsi-3.10/board/ remotely
    by sshing to board

     e.g.
     ssh root@armadillo800eva /root/tests/ltsi-3.10/board/sdhi.0/write-1k.sh
     ssh root@armadillo800eva /root/tests/ltsi-3.10/board/sdhi.0/write-10M.sh

5b. Controller executs tets found in tests/ltsi-3.10/controller/ locally

    e.g.
    ./tests/ltsi-3.10/controller/scifab/tty-ping.py \
	/dev/ttyFTDI-0 armadillo root /dev/ttySC1

6. Tests should exit with a value of 0 on success and any other value on error

   Tests may output informational messages to stdout or stderror

   Tests should output errors to stderror
